# CS104 HW6 Heap Checker

### Using the Tests
1. Keep this directory into your `hw5/heaps` folder, next to your source code + Makefile
2. Open a docker terminal and cd into this folder `hw5_heap_checker`
3. Initialize the test suite by running `cmake .`
4. Build the code by running `make`
4. Run the tests by typing `ctest --output-on-failure`.  To run the tests again, you only need to execute this command (and possibly make), not any others.
